# PBRify_Upscaler
My custom (ethical) set of AI models to upscale textures and generate PBR maps. Intended for use with RTX Remix

This is a complete set, consisting of a pre-made chain for chaiNNer & 3 models. These models do the following:
1. Upscale
2. Generate Normal Map
3. Generate Roughness Map

Written Guide:
1. Download chaiNNer: https://chainner.app/ and install the dependencies in the top right
2. Download the files from the main repo and extract
3. Open the .chn file in chaiNNer
4. Set an input and output directory for the textures
5. Load the model files by following the notes in the chain (refer to the image for more details)
6. Press the green run button at the top!
7. Ingest the saved textures in Remix's Ingestion tab

These were trained exclusively on high quality CC0 content from ambientCG, complying with their license. This makes it an ethical upscaler that you can use without concern ðŸ™‚

The chain will save your textures into separate folders for each one. They're labelled with the original texture name.

These models are licensed as CC0. **On a 4090, it takes 1.3 seconds to process a 512x512 texture in total**. This is in contrast to multiple minutes with Nvidia's official models
