4x-PBRify_UpscalerSPAN_Neutral.pth - A derivative of V4 of my SPAN upscaler, but with neutral colors. Essentially, it has no color shifting at all. This is good for upscaling specular, roughness, normal maps, etc. but not as good for upscaling albedos.


Old Models
4x-PBRify_UpscalerSPANV2.pth - My first released PBRify upscaler. This one has some major issues, namely color shifting & lack of detail

4x-PBRify_UpscalerSPANV3.pth - The second release of my PBRify SPAN upscaler. This one improved on V2 a LOT with additional detail, deblurring, and colors, but is also oversharpened and unbalanced on many textures
